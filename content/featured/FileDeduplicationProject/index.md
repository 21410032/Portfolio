Developed a storage optimization system to reduce data redundancy by breaking files into 4KB blocks, hashing them, and storing only unique blocks in a database. Achieved significant storage reduction through inline block-level deduplication, with a web interface for file uploads, real-time storage tracking, and efficient file reconstruction.
